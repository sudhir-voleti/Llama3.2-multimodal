It facilitates an average of 28 million trips per day and has facilitated 47 billion trips since its inception in 2010.[2] In 2023, the company had a take rate (revenue as a percentage of gross bookings) of 28.7% for mobility services and 18.3% for food delivery.[2]\n",

Some of these conducts were revealed by a leak of documents showing controversial activity between 2013 and 2017 under the leadership of Travis Kalanick. \n",

            "In 2009, Garrett Camp, a co-founder of StumbleUpon, came up with the idea to create Uber to make it easier and cheaper to procure direct transportation. Camp and Travis Kalanick had spent $800 hiring a private driver on New Year's Eve, which they deemed excessive, and Camp was also inspired by his difficulty in finding a taxi on a snowy night in Paris.[8][9] The prototype of the mobile app was built by Camp and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick as the \"mega advisor\" to the company.[9]\n",

He did not feel that regular cars would be attractive. When Wingz, Inc. launched in 2011 with the first ridesharing website in the world using regular drivers, he felt that Wingz was illegal and contacted authorities to stop regular drivers from giving rides.

If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations.[80] Uber argued that it is \"a technology company\" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies.[80] Uber's strategy was generally to \"seek forgiveness rather than permission\".[81] In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations.[82] Uber's response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy.[80][83]\n",

The documents revealed attempts to lobby Joe Biden, Olaf Scholz and George Osborne; how Emmanuel Macron secretly aided Uber lobbying in France, and use of a kill switch during police raids to conceal data. Travis Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry, saying \"I think it's worth it, violence guarantees success\".[85]\n",

            "In March 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called \"Greyball\" to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media.[88][89][90] While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon,[91][92][93] and the United States Department of Justice,[94][95][96] Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose.[97][98] The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017.[99][100][101] A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a \"panic button\" system, codenamed \"Ripley\", that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids.[102] Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.[103][104]\n",

            "Dead mileage specifically causes unnecessary carbon emissions and traffic congestion.[106] A study published in September 2019 found that taxis had lower rider waiting time and vehicle empty driving time, and thus contribute less to congestion and pollution in downtown areas.[107] However, a 2018 report noted that ridesharing complements public transit.[108] A study published in July 2018 found that Uber and Lyft are creating more traffic and congestion.[109][110][111] A study published in March 2016 found that in Los Angeles and Seattle the passenger occupancy for Uber services is higher than that of taxi services, and concluded that Uber rides reduce congestion on the premise that they replace taxi rides.[112] Studies citing data from 2010 to 2019 found that Uber rides are made in addition to taxi rides, and replace walking, bike rides, and bus rides, in addition to the Uber vehicles having a low average occupancy rate, all of which increases congestion. This increase in congestion has led some cities to levy taxes on rides taken with ridesharing companies.[113] Another study shows that the surge factor pricing mechanism used for ridehailing services are informative for predicting taxi bookings as well, and that taxis incorporating this relative price can improve allocative efficiency and demand prediction.[114]\n",

Hackers used employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a \"credential stuffing\" method) to gain access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber's developers. The hackers located credentials for the company's Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files, and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 Amazon S3 buckets. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data.[139][140] Uber was subsequently criticized for concealing this data breach.[141] Dara Khosrowshahi publicly apologized.[142][143] In September 2018, in the largest multi-state settlement of a data breach, Uber paid $148 million to the Federal Trade Commission, and admitted that internal access to consumers' personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false, and stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data.[144] In November 2018, Uber's British divisions were fined £385,000 (reduced to £308,000) by the Information Commissioner's Office.[145]\n",
